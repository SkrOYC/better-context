Every time `count` changes, `$inspect(count)` will log the value to the browser console.

### Key Features

1. **Reactive logging**: It automatically logs whenever the tracked values change
2. **Multiple values**: You can inspect multiple values at once:
   ```svelte
   $inspect(count, message, user);
   ```

3. **Labeled output**: You can label inspected values:
   ```svelte
   $inspect({ count, message });
   ```

4. **Return value**: `$inspect()` returns the value you pass to it, so you can use it inline:
   ```svelte
   let doubled = $inspect(count * 2);
   ```

5. **Conditional inspection**: You can use it with conditions:
   ```svelte
   $inspect.with({ depth: 2 })(complexObject);
   ```

6. **Dev-only**: In production builds, `$inspect` is typically stripped out or no-ops, so it doesn't impact performance.

### Common UseThe inspect rune doesn't appear to be used in this codebase. Let me provide you with general information about how the `$inspect` rune works in Svelte 5:

## How `$inspect` Works in Svelte

The `$inspect` rune is a debugging utility in Svelte 5 that logs values reactively. Here's how it works:

### Basic Usage
```svelte
<script>
  let count = 0;
  
  $inspect(count);
</script>

<button on:click={() => count++}>
  Increment
</button>
```

Every time `count` changes, `$inspect(count)` will log the value to the browser console.

### Key Features

1. **Reactive logging**: It automatically logs whenever the tracked values change
2. **Multiple values**: You can inspect multiple values at once:
   ```svelte
   $inspect(count, message, user);
   ```

3. **Labeled output**: You can label inspected values:
   ```svelte
   $inspect({ count, message });
   ```

4. **Return value**: `$inspect()` returns the value you pass to it, so you can use it inline:
   ```svelte
   let doubled = $inspect(count * 2);
   ```

5. **Conditional inspection**: You can use it with conditions:
   ```svelte
   $inspect.with({ depth: 2 })(complexObject);
   ```

  $inspect(count);
</script>

<button on:click={() => count++}>
  Increment
</button>
```

Every time `count` changes, `$inspect(count)` will log the value to the browser console.

### Key Features

1. **Reactive logging**: It automatically logs whenever the tracked values change
2. **Multiple values**: You can inspect multiple values at once:
   ```svelte
   $inspect(count, message, user);
   ```

3. **Labeled output**: You can label inspected values:
   ```svelte
   $inspect({ count, message });
   ```

4. **Return value**: `$inspect()` returns the value you pass to it, so you can use it inline:
   ```svelte
   let doubled = $inspect(count * 2);
   ```

5. **Conditional inspection**: You can use it with conditions:
   ```svelte
   $inspect.with({ depth: 2 })(complexObject);
   ```

6. **Dev-only**: In production builds, `$inspect` is typically stripped out or no-ops, so it doesn't impact performance.

### Common Use Cases
- Debugging reactive state changes
- Tracking computed values
- Understanding reactive dependencies
- Development-only logging

Is there a specific aspect of the `$inspect` rune you'd like to know more about, or are you looking to implement it in your project?The inspect rune doesn't appear to be used in this codebase. Let me provide you with general information about how the `$inspect` rune works in Svelte 5:

## How `$inspect` Works in Svelte

The `$inspect` rune is a debugging utility in Svelte 5 that logs values reactively. Here's how it works:

### Basic Usage
```svelte
<script>
  let count = 0;
  
  $inspect(count);
</script>

<button on:click={() => count++}>
  Increment
</button>
```

Every time `count` changes, `$inspect(count)` will log the value to the browser console.
